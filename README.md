Just a simple RPE calculator (and bar loader) written in Elm. Uses custom RPE values set by the coaches at my gym, so they may be a little different than yours.

# Dev
`$ npm install`

`$ npm run serve`

# Deploying
`$ npx elm make src/Main.elm --output elm.js --optimize`

`$ npx uglifyjs elm.js --compress 'pure_funcs="F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A9",pure_getters=true,keep_fargs=false,unsafe_comps=true,unsafe=true,passes=2' --output=elm.js && npx uglifyjs elm.js --mangle --output=elm.js`
